# ChoreTracker

ChoreTracker is a web-based family calendar and chore tracker inspired by Skylight.
It is intended to provide parents with a portal to link Google and Microsoft calendars,
manage households, and assign chores with rewards.

## Project Overview
- **SSO**: Google and Microsoft login for parents/guardians; kid logins can be simplified with PIN/magic link.

- **Chores**: Recurring chores (daily with weekday/full week options, weekly, monthly) with points and rewards.
- **Views**: Parent portal for configuration plus kid-friendly views for daily chores and calendar awareness.
